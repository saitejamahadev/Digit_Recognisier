# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine learning and OpenCV.
### In this Repository we will be doing hand written digit recognition using OpenCV and Convolutional Neural Networks.
First we design and train the convnet model and then use the OpenCV to read images from Webcam and feed it to the model as input to the models predict method.
* Import all the necessary dependencies.
* Load data set from the Keras library & check data shapes.
* Pre-process the data i.e Nomalize, Onehotencode the data labels and reshape the data .
* Define and design the CNN network.
* Compile and Fit the model.
* Save the model weights to be used in the CV2_app.ipynb
* Load the model weights saved from cnn_model.ipynb into cv2_app.
* Read the Image from webcam and process the image.
* Input the processed image to the newural net and check the output.

**Depedencies**
* Installing Anaconda Distribution will resolve all the dependencies.
